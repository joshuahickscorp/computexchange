# SITE-CLAIMS · the receipts ledger for the public page

Every factual sentence on `web/index.html` traces to a row in this file, and every row carries
`path:line` receipts with a short quote of the evidencing code, test, or doc. Anything that could
not be evidenced was not softened · it was killed, and the kill is recorded here so it stays dead.

Audit: 2026-07-01, 26 agents · 12 claim finders, each followed by an adversarial receipt checker
that re-opened every cited line and tried to refute the sentence, plus rig / download / routes
auditors. 10 claims confirmed as corrected below · 1 contested (claim 1, parser flaw found in the
proof tooling itself) · 1 killed (claim 9, replaced by a narrower true sentence).

Transcription note: the repo dash gate bans em and en dashes in every file, so where a quoted
source line contains one it is transcribed as `·`. Line numbers are exact as of commit `32bf80d`.

## 1 · prove-local-count · corrected, parser fixed, number re-pinned

**Line the page prints:** `make prove-local · 168 pass · 0 skip · 0 fail · a matrix-only run,
tallied by grep over its own ledger`. 168 is from a fresh SKIP_LIVE=1 run on 2026-07-02, AFTER
the parser fix below, and equals the 162 top-level matrix tests plus 6 capability lines.

**Receipts:**
- `scripts/prove-local.sh:92` · `printf '%s\t%s\t%s\n' "$status" "$cap" "$*" >>"$LEDGER_FILE"` · every check appends one ledger line
- `scripts/prove-local.sh:198` · `if (cd control && go test -tags integration -count=1 -v ./... )` · the integration matrix feed
- `scripts/prove-local.sh:1017` · `pass=$(grep -c '^PASS' "$LEDGER_FILE" || true)` · the tally is a grep over the ledger
- `scripts/prove-local.sh:1030` · `die "$failc capability check(s) FAILED · not release-candidate clean"` · any FAIL aborts
- `scripts/prove-local.sh:209` · `grep -E '^--- (PASS|FAIL): Test[A-Za-z]+ '` · THE FLAW: `[A-Za-z]+` drops digit-named tests

**Notes:** the adversarial checker refuted the naive count. The matrix parser regex silently
dropped any top-level test with a digit in its name: `TestPerTaskSecsFromP90FallbackAndConversion`
ran and passed in the 2026-07-01 run but produced zero ledger lines, so the printed `167 pass` was
one short of the 168 checks that actually passed. FIXED in this shift: the regex is now
`Test[A-Za-z0-9_]+` (`scripts/prove-local.sh:209`) and the re-run records 168 pass · 0 skip ·
0 fail with the recovered test present in the ledger. The count is ledger capability lines, not
raw test cases (the whole Go unit suite and the whole cargo suite are one line each), and a
`SKIP_LIVE=1` run is matrix-only · the page says which.

## 2 · queue-postgres · verified

**Line:** The job queue is a plain Postgres table claimed with FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED · there is
no Kafka, RabbitMQ, NATS, or Redis anywhere in the dependency tree.

**Receipts:**
- `control/scheduler.go:521` · `FOR UPDATE OF t SKIP LOCKED`
- `control/scheduler.go:454` · `FROM tasks t`
- `control/scheduler.go:526` · `status = 'running', started_at = now()`
- `db/schema.sql:8` · `-- The job queue is Postgres, not NATS (BLACKHOLE compression): workers claim work`
- `control/go.mod:8` · `github.com/jackc/pgx/v5 v5.10.0` · five direct deps total, no broker
- `agent/Cargo.toml:12` · `[dependencies]` · inspected in full, no broker client

## 3 · two-binaries · corrected

**Line:** The core is two binaries · a Rust supplier agent and a Go control plane · a supplier
runs only the agent, a buyer needs only the REST API, and an optional buyer CLI and macOS menu
bar app sit on top.

**Receipts:**
- `README.md:3` · `Two binaries: a **Rust supplier agent** (agent/) and a **Go control plane** (control/)`
- `agent/Cargo.toml:9` · `name = "cx-agent"`
- `Dockerfile.control:46` · `ENTRYPOINT ["/control"]` · the control plane is operator infrastructure
- `cli/README.md:3` · `A single stdlib-only Go binary for the buyer REST API` · optional third binary
- `macapp/README.md:3` · `A SwiftUI MenuBarExtra app that is the operator's face for the Rust cx-agent`
- `sdk/python/README.md:3` · dependency-free library, not a binary

**Notes:** the raw candidate ("the whole product is two binaries, a user runs nothing else") was
false both ways: the repo builds four executables, and no single user runs both core binaries.
The corrected line states who runs what.

## 4 · models-metal · corrected

**Line:** Inference runs through Candle in pure Rust · Metal by default on Apple Silicon, CUDA as
a build flag · shipping all-MiniLM-L6-v2 and bge-small-en-v1.5 embeddings, Whisper tiny and base
transcription, and quantized Llama 3.2 1B Instruct.

**Receipts:**
- `agent/src/runners.rs:1` · `//! Job runners · the closed job-type contract, with REAL Candle inference.`
- `agent/src/models.rs:101` · `repo: "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2"`
- `agent/src/models.rs:111` · `repo: "BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5"`
- `agent/src/models.rs:142` · `"openai/whisper-tiny"` · and `:140` whisper-base
- `agent/src/models.rs:195` · `repo: "unsloth/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-GGUF"` · `:196` Q4_K_M file
- `agent/Cargo.toml:47` · `default = ["metal"]` · `:53` `cuda = [...]` opt-in feature
- `agent/src/models.rs:36` · `match Device::new_metal(0)` · Metal tried first

**Notes:** Qwen 0.5B/7B refs exist in models.rs but are excluded from the page: the 7B GGUF URL
404s on HuggingFace today and `models.rs:176` itself marks Qwen output parity UNPROVEN. The four
listed model families' weight URLs were live-probed and resolve.

## 5 · chunking-scheduler · corrected

**Line:** Jobs are split into tasks sized for a 45 second runtime target, and the scheduler
hard-filters every assignment on memory fit, model availability, hardware class, memory-pressure
throttle, and the job's budget cap · quiet hours are enforced by the agent on the device itself.

**Receipts:**
- `control/api.go:2034` · `const targetTaskSecs = 45`
- `control/api.go:2050` · `n := int(effectiveThroughput(jobType, avgLineBytes) * targetTaskSecs)`
- `control/scheduler.go:346` · `// Scheduler V2 hard filter (the #1 goal: a worker can NEVER claim a task it` (cannot run)
- `control/scheduler.go:468` · memory fit · `:470` throttle · `:471` hw class · `:473` model availability
- `control/scheduler.go:498-506` · budget governor gate against `j.max_usd`
- `agent/src/config.rs:328` · `pub fn is_eligible_to_run(&self, now_hour: u8, on_battery: bool) -> bool` · quiet hours on-device

**Notes:** the candidate bundled quiet hours into the scheduler; in truth `throttled` covers only
memory pressure and quiet hours live agent-side. The corrected line attributes each enforcement
point. More hard filters exist than the five named (supplier active, job-type support, residency,
reputation floor, private pools) · the page understates rather than overstates.

## 6 · verification-stack · verified

**Line:** Results are verified with honeypot known-answer tasks, within-class redundancy, N-way
majority voting, and reputation-weighted audits with a spot-check floor of 0.25 · a failed
honeypot docks reputation, claws back the task credit, and auto-quarantines the supplier.

**Receipts:**
- `db/schema.sql:236` · `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS honeypots (`
- `control/verification.go:98` · `if info.IsHoneypot && v.checkSampled(info.TaskID, checkProb())`
- `control/verification.go:20` · `Within-class redundancy is the trust spine.`
- `control/verification.go:484` · `resolveTiebreak runs the real N-way majority vote over all committed results`
- `control/verification.go:284` · `verifyCheckProbFloor = 0.25` · `:281` `even the most trusted worker is audited ~1 task in 4`
- `control/verification.go:125` · `ClawbackTaskCredit` · `:128` `QuarantineSupplier`
- `control/store.go:1590` · `const quarantineRepFloor = 0.2`
- `db/schema.sql:112` · ledger kinds include `'clawback'`

**Notes:** 0.25 is the floor reached at reputation 1.0; at or below the 0.90 trust floor the audit
probability is 1.0 and it ramps linearly between. Cross-class byte mismatches never dock and a
no-majority vote never punishes.

## 7 · quote-before-spend · corrected

**Line:** Buyers get a price quote before any spend via POST /v1/quote and /v1/quote/pipeline,
and a max_usd cap set at job submission is enforced at dispatch by a budget governor that pauses
the job before the cap is breached.

**Receipts:**
- `control/api.go:117` · `mux.Handle("POST /v1/quote", ...)` · `:118` `/v1/quote/pipeline`
- `control/api.go:363` · `// MaxUSD is the optional buyer hard spend cap (Budget Governor, ...)`
- `control/scheduler.go:487` · `-- spend cap, NEVER dispatch a new task whose projected charge would breach`
- `control/scheduler.go:498-506` · the projected-charge gate in the claim SQL
- `control/scheduler.go:819` · `SET budget_state = 'paused_for_budget'`
- `control/integration_test.go:1322` · `func TestBudgetCapPausesDispatch(t *testing.T)` · proves the pause and the resume

**Notes:** correction · the pipeline quote itself is advisory (`control/quote.go:564` "it persists
nothing and binds nothing"); what binds is `max_usd` on POST /v1/jobs. The page says the cap
binds, not the quote.

## 8 · payout-lifecycle · corrected

**Line:** Supplier credits are written held until a hold window expires, then either released
against a real transfer reference or marked ready when owed with no payout rail · settlement is
idempotent via a UNIQUE(task_id, kind) ledger index · a read-only reconciliation pass audits
released credits against actual Stripe transfers every 15 minutes and never moves money.

**Receipts:**
- `control/payment.go:112` · `PayoutStatus: PayoutHeld, // held until the hold window expires`
- `control/workers.go:302` · ready when the rail is unconfigured · `:308` released with ref
- `db/schema.sql:133` · `CHECK (kind <> 'supplier_credit' OR payout_status <> 'released' OR payout_ref IS NOT NULL)`
- `db/schema.sql:140` · `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX ... ledger_task_kind_uniq ON ledger_entries (task_id, kind)`
- `control/store.go:1890` · `ON CONFLICT (task_id, kind) DO NOTHING`
- `control/reconcile.go:18` · `It NEVER moves money, marks a row, or "fixes" a` (drift) · `:26` every 15 minutes

**Notes:** corrected from a linear held to ready to released pipeline · ready and released are
alternative outcomes of the release sweep, not stages. Found in passing: `DuePayouts` selects only
`payout_status = 'held'` (`control/store.go:2191`) so a `ready` row is not re-picked despite the
comment at `workers.go:301`, and `ready` is missing from the schema enum comment at
`schema.sql:121`. Flagged as follow-up work, not a page claim.

## 9 · device-identity · KILLED

The candidate ("no account creation flow exists; device + payment method is the only identity")
is architecturally false and was killed. POST /v1/signup (`control/api.go:92`) accepts email +
password, stores a bcrypt hash (`control/accounts.go:192`, `db/schema.sql:159`), and POST
/v1/login (`control/api.go:93`) is a full credentialed login. The device-is-the-account behavior
is real but is a client layer: the console silently generates and stores credentials per browser
(`web/demo.html:834`). The page must never say no account exists, because one demonstrably does.

## 9b · no-sign-in-screen · verified replacement

**Line:** There is no sign-in screen · on first use the console silently provisions a
device-local account, and the only credential a person ever connects by hand is a payment method.

**Receipts:**
- `web/demo.html:823` · `// No sign-in, no password. On first use we silently provision a device-local buyer`
- `web/demo.html:834` · `c={email:'dev-'+rnd()+rnd()+'@device.computexchange.net',password:...}` · generated, never typed
- `web/demo.html:459` · `Connect a payment method to run real jobs. It is the only thing we verify · no account, no password.`
- `control/accounts.go:26` · `// POST /v1/signup {"email","password"} -> 201 {...}` · the silent client calls this
- `db/schema.sql:159` · `password_hash TEXT, -- bcrypt; NULL = no password set (seed / API-key-only)`

## 10 · batch-api-sdk · verified

**Line:** The control plane serves an OpenAI-compatible Batch API at /v1/files and /v1/batches,
and the Python SDK is a single file that imports only the Python standard library.

**Receipts:**
- `control/openai.go:3` · `// openai.go · an OpenAI-compatible Batch API mapped onto the native job pipeline.`
- `control/api.go:143` · `POST /v1/files` · `:145` `POST /v1/batches` · `:146` `GET /v1/batches/{id}`
- `control/integration_test.go:2866` · posts to `/v1/batches`
- `sdk/python/computeexchange/__init__.py:20-25` · imports are json, struct, time, urllib only

**Notes:** OpenAI-compatible in shape for the Batch API surface specifically, not a general
OpenAI clone · the page keeps that scope.

## 11 · money-rail-stub · KILLED as stale, corrected

**Line:** Supplier payouts are real Stripe Connect transfers when the Stripe key is configured ·
an unconfigured deployment keeps credits marked owed and never fakes a paid transfer.

**Receipts:**
- `control/payment.go:165` · `// StripePayout is the REAL money rail: a Stripe Connect transfer to the supplier's` (account)
- `control/payment.go:208` · `"https://api.stripe.com/v1/transfers"` · with per-payout Idempotency-Key
- `control/main.go:141-142` · rail selected when `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` is set
- `control/main.go:148` · `payout rail: none configured · credits reach 'ready' (owed), never 'released'`
- `control/connect.go:13` · supplier Express onboarding with Stripe-hosted KYC

**Notes:** the handoff expected "the licensed money-transfer rail is the stub" to be the page's
honest limitation. That is stale: a real transfer rail exists behind the key gate (two old
comments at `payment.go:21` and `:155` predate it and fed the myth). The page's honest limitation
is therefore the download state instead · see the download audit: closed alpha, no public
artifact, unsigned local build (`macapp/assemble-app.sh:12`, `GO_LIVE.md:3`,
`RELEASE_CANDIDATE.md:124`).

## 12 · pricing-constant · verified

**Line:** The seeded catalogue prices embeddings at $0.001 per 1,000 units · Llama 3.2 1B batch
inference at $0.002 per 1,000 units · Whisper transcription from $0.004 per audio minute · the
platform take defaults to 3%.

**Receipts:**
- `db/schema.sql:299` · `('all-minilm-l6-v2', ..., 0.00100000, ...)` · USD per 1,000 units per `:287`
- `db/schema.sql:301` · `('llama-3.2-1b-instruct-q4', ..., 0.00200000, ...)`
- `db/schema.sql:303` · `('whisper-tiny', ..., 0.004...)` · per audio-minute per `:277`
- `control/seed.go:97` · the Go seed mirrors the embedding price
- `control/payment.go:63` · `const def, lo, hi = 3.0, 1.0, 5.0` · take clamped to the 1% to 5% band

**Notes:** prices are served from the models table, not a Go constant (`control/api.go:1145`).
The one serif monument on the page is $0.001 per 1,000 embeddings (`db/schema.sql:299`).

## 13 · per-device capability detail · added in the site shift (verified)

The Studio (Apple Silicon) and Spark (NVIDIA CUDA) beats are each one line now (owner call ·
the granular under-text was cleared); the architecture-specific capability receipts they briefly
carried moved into the `how it works` beat as a second console group (backends, executors,
headroom, sandbox), and the earn line was made fully device-agnostic. The receipts below still
back those relocated rows one-for-one. Every claim was adversarially receipt-checked (a skeptic
re-opened each cited line and tried to refute the exact wording) before it shipped; the refuted
phrasings are recorded as kills below so they stay dead.

**Studio · Apple Silicon lines:**
- `apple silicon runs inference on the metal gpu by default · real candle in pure rust`:
  `agent/Cargo.toml:47` `default = ["metal"]` · `agent/src/models.rs:36` `match Device::new_metal(0)`
  Metal tried first, never faked · `agent/src/runners.rs:1` REAL Candle inference.
- `all six verified executors run here · embeddings, inference, transcription, classification,
  extraction, rerank`: `agent/src/hardware.rs:436` the six base job types. The six are the
  output-verified catalogue (claim 6); the seventh `custom` container lane is excluded on purpose,
  it is reputation-trusted only.
- `classification and extraction are real llama passes, not prompt wrappers`:
  `agent/src/runners.rs:1804` `backend.generate_batch_shared_prefix(&prompts, 12)` · a full batched
  quantized forward pass, per-row output byte-for-byte.
- `batched decode stays byte-identical to serial at about 1.5x on an m3 pro`:
  `docs/GPU_CAPABILITY.md:45` byte-identical, 138.7 tok/s = 1.52x at batch 32 on an M3 Pro.
- `the menu bar app is the operator's face · status, earnings, thermal, start and stop`:
  `macapp/README.md:3` the operator's face for the Rust cx-agent (Mac-only, claim 3).
- `battery and quiet hours enforced on the device itself · eligibility never leaves the mac`:
  `agent/src/config.rs:328` `is_eligible_to_run(now_hour, on_battery)` · `agent/src/main.rs:151`
  `on_battery` shells out to `pmset -g batt` (macOS-only) · `agent/src/types.rs:351` the heartbeat
  carries no battery or quiet-hours field.

**Spark · NVIDIA CUDA lines:**
- `the nvidia box runs the same six executors on cuda · a device branch, not a rewrite`:
  `agent/Cargo.toml:49` cuda "Mirrors metal exactly ... a device branch, not a rewrite" · `:53`
  the cuda opt-in feature · `agent/src/models.rs:47` `Device::new_cuda(0)`.
- `the 7b batch model is gated by a 40gb memory floor, not the backend`:
  `agent/src/models.rs:153` `BIG_LLAMA_MIN_MEMORY_GB = 40.0`, gated to high-VRAM workers
  (nvidia_48g/80g/180g AND the large Apple unified-memory classes) · a memory floor, not a backend
  gate, so a large-memory Mac clears it too.
- `the batched win is bigger on cuda · up to 9.6x, measured on an a100`:
  `docs/GPU_CAPABILITY.md:64` up to 9.6x at batch 64, 2345 tok/s on a RunPod A100 80GB.
- `a locked-down container sandbox only a cuda host can run · no network, read-only root, all caps
  dropped, a hard timeout`: `agent/src/sandbox.rs:8` the hardened profile · `agent/src/sandbox.rs:12`
  "Linux + Docker + the NVIDIA Container Toolkit only" · `agent/src/hardware.rs:406` the `custom`
  job is advertised only on an NVIDIA worker with a reachable Docker daemon.
- `reputation-trusted, not output-verified · metering it per gpu-second is the road ahead`:
  `agent/src/runners.rs:2369` "metered per GPU-second and reputation-trusted, never
  honeypot/redundancy output-checked" · `docs/internal/ACCRETION.md:279` GPU-second billing is
  "Remaining (Wave 5+)" · `control/api.go:1674` custom jobs charge a per-task estimate today, not
  per second.

**Kills recorded so they stay dead:**
- NOT "no build flag" · Metal is a default-on feature, disabled with `--no-default-features`
  (`agent/Cargo.toml:47`); the page says "metal by default".
- NOT "the 7b a mac cannot" · the floor is memory (40 GB), not backend, so a large-memory Mac
  clears it too (`agent/src/models.rs:153`).
- NOT "metered per GPU-second" in the present tense · billing is roadmap
  (`docs/internal/ACCRETION.md:279`); the receipts-dialog line was corrected to match the road text.
- NOT "flip your Mac online" as a universal earn line · quiet hours are device-agnostic, battery is
  Mac-only, and a Spark reports `on_battery=false` (`agent/src/main.rs:148`).

## Appendix · composite page lines

Three page lines compose multiple ledger claims rather than quoting one; their constituent
receipts, so the ctrl-F contract holds:

- **Hero thesis** `a verified spot market for batch inference · Metal by default, CUDA as a
  build flag`: verified = claim 6 · market with seeded prices and settlement = claims 12 and 8 ·
  batch inference = claims 4 and 10 · Metal default / CUDA flag = claim 4
  (`agent/Cargo.toml:47`, `:53`).
- **Drop row** `drop your data · the pipeline is detected · ...`: detection is the quote scan
  (`control/quote.go:57` `DetectedFields ... top-level keys in the sample`,
  `control/quote.go:561` "handlePipelineQuote prices a detected MULTI-STAGE pipeline"); the
  model list is claim 4.
- **Earn row** `flip your device online and it earns while it idles · quiet hours are enforced on
  the device itself`: made fully device-agnostic (owner call · any supported device, not just a
  Mac, can supply · the specific-device enumeration and the Mac-only battery clause were dropped).
  Supplier earnings are the held supplier_credit ledger entries written per verified task (claim 8,
  `control/payment.go:108` `Kind: KindSupplierCredit`) · quiet-hours eligibility is device-agnostic
  and on-device (claim 5, `agent/src/config.rs:328`) · the 3% take is claim 12
  (`control/payment.go:63`). Battery remains a real but Mac-only gate (`agent/src/main.rs:148`), now
  left off the page as device-specific detail.
- **Proof row** `results come back verified · every run ends in a receipt`: verification is
  claim 6; the receipt is real and assembled per job and per pipeline
  (`control/receipt.go:59` `func assembleClearingReceipt(...) ClearingReceipt`,
  `control/api.go:1833` `handleJobReceipt`, `control/pipeline.go:188` `handlePipelineReceipt`).

Page structure note (2026-07-02): the page is desktop-only by owner decision · under 900px it
becomes a hand-off screen (share / email / copy the link, all functional, no claims made). The
full claim lines live verbatim in the receipts dialog; the on-page rows are strict subsets of
ledger lines plus the composite rows mapped above.
